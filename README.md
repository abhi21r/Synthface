# Face Recognition System using Python and TensorFlow/Keras

## System Overview
- Developed a robust face recognition system using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.
- Implemented CNN model with convolutional layers for feature extraction, followed by max-pooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions.
- Incorporated dense layers for classification, culminating in a softmax output layer for multi-class facial recognition.
- Trained the model using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss, achieving 1.000 validation accuracy after 15 epochs.
- Saved the trained model in .h5 format for potential deployment in real-time face recognition applications.
